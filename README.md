3190 project Q-Learning 
This project implements q-learning in a dynamic environment and shows how
it forms an effective policy over time. This is just a basic implementation where
any action you take progresses you to the next state automatically ( linear states )

To run this program with python3
run command:

python3 qlearn.py

You can change alpha, gamma, and epsilon, (learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate) 
and see how the ouputs change. If you change these values you may potentially also have to change
the number of episodes (iterations) that you want the q-algorithm to run
